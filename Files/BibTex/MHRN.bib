abstract = {Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to improve entity and relation representations, enhancing the accuracy of link prediction tasks. Recently, deep neural networks have been widely adopted for KGE. However, existing methods mainly focus on improving feature interactions through permutation and reshaping embeddings from a translational perspective, often overlooking the rotational interactions between entities and relations. Furthermore, these models tend to treat all relations in the knowledge graph uniformly, neglecting their heterogeneous characteristics. A novel KGE model with a multi-perspective hierarchical relation network (MHRN) is proposed to mitigate the two problems. Specifically, it generates multi-perspective rotation embeddings by leveraging a group equivariant convolutional layer that incorporates both translation and rotation transformations. This approach captures rotational interactions and significantly enhances the expressiveness of the neural network, all without adding extra parameters. Additionally, the hierarchical relation component employs relation-oriented convolutional filters to preserve the diverse characteristics of different relations. The hierarchical mechanism further extends the receptive field, integrating global information while retaining detailed local features during the aggregation process. Experimental results demonstrate that MHRN excels in capturing rotational interactions and preserving relational characteristics. It delivers outstanding performance on seven benchmark datasets, surpassing baseline methods in 2 out of 4 indicators on FB15k-237, and in all 4 indicators on both FB15k and YAGO3â€“10 datasets.}
